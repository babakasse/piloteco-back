# PilotEco Backend Improvement Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the PilotEco backend application, a SaaS environmental management tool for SMEs with a Marketplace. The plan is based on an analysis of the current codebase and aims to address key areas for enhancement to ensure the application is robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## Current State Analysis

The PilotEco backend is built with PHP 8.4.3+ and Symfony 7.2, using API Platform for REST API development. The application currently has:

- A simple data model with User and Company entities
- Basic authentication using JWT
- Three main controllers: RegisterController, LoginController, and MeController
- Docker-based deployment with FrankenPHP and Caddy

While the foundation is solid, there are several areas that need improvement to make the application production-ready and to support future growth.
